# About A and S Home Furnishings

## Hi, we're Andy and Sally!

We are a family run business working from our large furniture showroom in Barton-upon-Humber. Our aim is to provide quality new, up-cycled and re-purposed furniture at affordable prices, along with friendly and personal service.

We also offer a house removals and business relocation service. Our house clearance, commercial property clearance and auction services cover Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire and surrounding areas.

We understand there are many reasons for needing to empty a property and the process, especially following loss or eviction can be financially daunting and upsetting.

Our years of experience means there are many options we can offer to make the experience run as smoothly and cost effective as possible - including a 24 hour service where required.

We can offer to take care of your vacant property on a long or short term basis including gardening and internal cleaning.

We pride ourselves on our established reputation and excellent customer service so please call us for confidential advice.

You are welcome to browse our furniture showroom where you'll find a selection of new furniture ranges as well as quality up-cycled and re-purposed furniture which has been given a fresh lease of life.

We will even undertake your own bespoke up cycling projects and commissions upon request.

There are many ranges of new solid wood furniture on display including bedroom furniture, kitchen and dining furniture and living room furniture as well as mirrors, home accessories and gifts.

New stock arrives daily and we can order upon request from our catalogues and have it delivered within just a few days.
