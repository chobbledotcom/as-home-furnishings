## Hi, we're Andy and Sally!

We are a family run business working from our large furniture showroom in Barton-upon-Humber. Our aim is to provide quality beds, mattresses, top brand sofas and new furniture at affordable prices, along with friendly and personal service.

We also offer a house removals and business relocation service. Our house clearance, commercial property clearance and auction services cover Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire and surrounding areas.

We understand there are many reasons for needing to empty a property and the process, especially following loss or eviction can be financially daunting and upsetting.

Our years of experience means there are many options we can offer to make the experience run as smoothly and cost effective as possible - including a 24 hour service where required.

We can offer to take care of your vacant property on a long or short term basis including gardening and internal cleaning.

We pride ourselves on our established reputation and excellent customer service so please call us for confidential advice.

You are welcome to browse our furniture showroom where you'll find a selection of great quality beds, mattresses, top brand sofas and new furniture at outstanding prices.

New stock arrives weekly and we can order upon request from our show models and catalogues and have it delivered within just a few days.

### Meet Sally!

Sally can be found in our showroom, ready to expertly guide you through our product options and assist you in making informed purchasing decisions.
